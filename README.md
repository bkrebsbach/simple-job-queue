# simple-job-queue

Simple in-memory job queue with a REST API.

## TODOs
* Missing tests for handler and queue packages
* Need to create Dockerfile and docker-compose for running the service in a container
* Needs better observability: emit stats, handle tracing, more logging.
* Could use some clean up in main (possibly using wire to construct dependencies)

## Local Dev

### Testing
Run `make test`

### Linting
Run `make lint`

### Running locally
Run `go run main.go`

## Spec:

The queue exposes a REST API that producers and consumers perform HTTP requests against in JSON. The queue supports the following operations:

### `/jobs/enqueue`
Add a job to the queue.  The job definition can be found below.
Returns the ID of the job

### `/jobs/dequeue`
Returns a job from the queue
Jobs are considered available for Dequeue if the job has not been concluded and has not dequeued already

### `/jobs/{job_id}/conclude`
Provided an input of a job ID, finish execution on the job and consider it done

### `/jobs/{job_id}`
Given an input of a job ID, get information about a job tracked by the queue

A job has the following attributes as part of its public API:

### `ID`: an integer to uniquely represent a job
The ID is assigned to a job by the queue once the job is enqueued

### `Type`: a string representing the class of operation
There are two types: `TIME_CRITICAL` and `NOT_TIME_CRITICAL`. Type is sent from the producer when a job is enqueued.
The Type is not considered by dequeue’s business logic.

### `Status`: an enum value indicating the current stage of the jobs’ execution.

There are 3 statuses: `QUEUED`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `CONCLUDED`


An example job returned from `jobs/{job_id}` could look like:

```
{
 "ID": 951,
 "Type": "TIME_CRITICAL",
 "Status": "IN_PROGRESS"
}
```
